##Un-features
* semicolons
* commas
* exceptions

##Features
* `?!'` in function names
* JS-style object/map literals
* pattern matching, destructuring
* error handling using Maybe<> or Either<> (I think you could describe exceptions based on this if you wanted to...?)
* first-class string interpolation
* first-class instrumentation visualization of a running system
* nice syntax for piping, like `->` in Clojure or `|>` in F#
* nice syntax for partial application of a function




##Testing
* idea: pluggable test setup; if a dependency has 4 interesting setup variations, which map to its own test suite and have corresponding mock implementations, theore
* property-based testing?
* simulation testing (behavior triggered by events, modelable as streams)

##Questions:
Named params: why don't I like them?
